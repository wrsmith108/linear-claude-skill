# Linear

Tools and workflows for managing issues, projects, and teams in Linear.

---

## ⚠️ Tool Availability (READ FIRST)

**This skill supports multiple tool backends. Use whichever is available:**

1. **MCP Tools (mcp__linear)** - Use if available in your tool set
2. **Linear CLI (`linear` command)** - Always available via Bash
3. **Helper Scripts** - For complex operations

**If MCP tools are NOT available**, use the Linear CLI via Bash:

```bash
# View an issue
linear issues view ENG-123

# Create an issue
linear issues create --title "Issue title" --description "Description"

# Update issue status (get state IDs first)
linear issues update ENG-123 -s "STATE_ID"

# Add a comment
linear issues comment add ENG-123 -m "Comment text"

# List issues
linear issues list
```

**Do NOT report "MCP tools not available" as a blocker** - use CLI instead.

---

## 🔐 Security: Varlock Integration

**CRITICAL**: Never expose API keys in terminal output or Claude's context.

### Safe Commands (Always Use)

```bash
# Validate LINEAR_API_KEY is set (masked output)
varlock load 2>&1 | grep LINEAR

# Run commands with secrets injected
varlock run -- npm run query -- "query { viewer { name } }"

# Check schema (safe - no values)
cat .env.schema | grep LINEAR
```

### Unsafe Commands (NEVER Use)

```bash
# ❌ NEVER - exposes key to Claude's context
linear config show
echo $LINEAR_API_KEY
printenv | grep LINEAR
cat .env
```

### Setup for New Projects

1. Create `.env.schema` with `@sensitive` annotation:
   ```bash
   # @type=string(startsWith=lin_api_) @required @sensitive
   LINEAR_API_KEY=
   ```

2. Add `LINEAR_API_KEY` to `.env` (never commit this file)

3. Configure MCP to use environment variable:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linear": {
         "env": { "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Use `varlock load` to validate before operations

---

## Quick Start (First-Time Users)

### 1. Check Your Setup

Run the setup check to verify your configuration:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will check:
- LINEAR_API_KEY is set and valid
- @linear/sdk is installed
- Linear CLI availability (optional)
- MCP configuration (optional)

### 2. Get API Key (If Needed)

If setup reports a missing API key:

1. Open [Linear](https://linear.app) in your browser
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) -> **Security & access** -> **Personal API keys**
3. Click **Create key** and copy the key (starts with `lin_api_`)
4. Add to your environment:

```bash
# Option A: Add to shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_your_key_here"

# Option B: Add to Claude Code environment
echo 'LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_your_key_here' >> ~/.claude/.env

# Then reload your shell or restart Claude Code
```

### 3. Test Connection

Verify everything works:

```bash
npm run query -- "query { viewer { name } }"
```

You should see your name from Linear.

### 4. Common Operations

```bash
# Create issue in a project
npm run ops -- create-issue "Project" "Title" "Description"

# Update issue status
npm run ops -- status Done ENG-123 ENG-124

# Create sub-issue
npm run ops -- create-sub-issue ENG-100 "Sub-task" "Details"

# Update project status
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 1" completed

# Show all commands
npm run ops -- help
```

See [Project Management Commands](#project-management-commands) for full reference.

## Project Planning Workflow

### Create Issues in the Correct Project from the Start

**Best Practice**: When planning a new phase or initiative, create the project and its issues together in a single planning session. Avoid creating issues in a catch-all project and moving them later.

#### Recommended Workflow

1. **Create the project first**:
   ```bash
   npm run ops -- create-project "Phase X: Feature Name" "My Initiative"
   ```

2. **Set project state to Planned**:
   ```bash
   npm run ops -- project-status "Phase X: Feature Name" planned
   ```

3. **Create issues directly in the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run ops -- create-issue "Phase X: Feature Name" "Parent task" "Description"
   npm run ops -- create-sub-issue ENG-XXX "Sub-task 1" "Description"
   npm run ops -- create-sub-issue ENG-XXX "Sub-task 2" "Description"
   ```

4. **Update project state when work begins**:
   ```bash
   npm run ops -- project-status "Phase X: Feature Name" in-progress
   ```

#### Why This Matters

- **Traceability**: Issues are linked to their project from creation
- **Metrics**: Project progress tracking is accurate from day one
- **Workflow**: No time wasted moving issues between projects
- **Organization**: Linear views and filters work correctly

#### Anti-Pattern to Avoid

❌ Creating issues in a "holding" project and moving them later:
```bash
# Don't do this
create-issue "Phase 6A" "New feature"  # Wrong project
# Later: manually move to Phase X      # Extra work
```

## Project Management Commands

### project-status

Update a project's state in Linear. Accepts user-friendly terminology that maps to Linear's API.

```bash
npm run ops -- project-status <project-name> <state>
```

**Valid States:**
| Input | Description | API Value |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `backlog` | Not yet started | backlog |
| `planned` | Scheduled for future | planned |
| `in-progress` | Currently active | started |
| `paused` | Temporarily on hold | paused |
| `completed` | Successfully finished | completed |
| `canceled` | Will not be done | canceled |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start working on a project
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 8: MCP Decision Engine" in-progress

# Mark project complete
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 8" completed

# Partial name matching works
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 8" paused
```

### link-initiative

Link an existing project to an initiative.

```bash
npm run ops -- link-initiative <project-name> <initiative-name>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Link a project to an initiative
npm run ops -- link-initiative "Phase 8: MCP Decision Engine" "Q1 Goals"

# Partial matching works
npm run ops -- link-initiative "Phase 8" "Q1 Goals"
```

### unlink-initiative

Remove a project from an initiative.

```bash
npm run ops -- unlink-initiative <project-name> <initiative-name>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Remove incorrect link
npm run ops -- unlink-initiative "Phase 8" "Linear Skill"

# Clean up test links
npm run ops -- unlink-initiative "Test Project" "Q1 Goals"
```

**Error Handling:**
- Returns error if project is not linked to the specified initiative
- Returns error if project or initiative not found

### Complete Project Lifecycle Example

```bash
# 1. Create project linked to initiative
npm run ops -- create-project "Phase 11: New Feature" "Q1 Goals"

# 2. Set state to planned
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 11" planned

# 3. Create issues in the project
npm run ops -- create-issue "Phase 11" "Parent task" "Description"
npm run ops -- create-sub-issue ENG-XXX "Sub-task 1" "Details"

# 4. Start work - update to in-progress
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 11" in-progress

# 5. Mark issues done
npm run ops -- status Done ENG-XXX ENG-YYY

# 6. Complete project
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase 11" completed

# 7. (Optional) Link to additional initiative
npm run ops -- link-initiative "Phase 11" "Q2 Goals"
```

## Tool Selection

Choose the right tool for the task:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **MCP (Official Server)** | Most operations - PREFERRED |
| **Helper Scripts** | Bulk operations, when MCP unavailable |
| **SDK scripts** | Complex operations (loops, conditionals) |
| **GraphQL API** | Operations not supported by MCP/SDK |

### MCP Server Configuration

**Use the official Linear MCP server** at `mcp.linear.app`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"],
      "env": { "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your_api_key" }
    }
  }
}
```

> **WARNING**: Do NOT use deprecated community servers. See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for details.

### MCP Reliability (Official Server)

| Operation | Reliability | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Create issue | ✅ High | Full support |
| Update status | ✅ High | Use `state: "Done"` directly |
| List/Search issues | ✅ High | Supports filters, queries |
| Add comment | ✅ High | Works with issue IDs |

### Quick Status Update

```bash
# Via MCP - use human-readable state names
update_issue with id="issue-uuid", state="Done"

# Via helper script (bulk operations)
node scripts/linear-helpers.mjs update-status Done 123 124 125
```

### Helper Script Reference

For detailed helper script usage, see **[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)**.

### Parallel Agent Execution

For bulk operations or background execution, use the `Linear-specialist` subagent:

```javascript
Task({
  description: "Update Linear issues",
  prompt: "Mark ENG-101, ENG-102, ENG-103 as Done",
  subagent_type: "Linear-specialist"
})
```

**When to use `Linear-specialist` (parallel):**
- Bulk status updates (3+ issues)
- Project status changes
- Creating multiple issues
- Sync operations after code changes

**When to use direct execution:**
- Single issue queries
- Viewing issue details
- Quick status checks
- Operations needing immediate results

See **[sync.md](sync.md)** for parallel execution patterns.

## Image Uploads

### Step 1: Extract the image from conversation context

Images shared inline in Claude Code are **not** saved to disk automatically — they live as base64 in the session JSONL. Use the extraction script:

```bash
# Find the current session JSONL
ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/*.jsonl | head -1

# Extract all inline images (saves to /tmp by default)
npx tsx scripts/extract-image.ts <path-to-session.jsonl>

# Or specify a custom output directory
npx tsx scripts/extract-image.ts <path-to-session.jsonl> ~/Desktop
```

This saves images to `/tmp/shared-image-0.png`, `/tmp/shared-image-1.png`, etc.

> **Always verify** the extracted image with the Read tool before uploading.

### Step 2: Create the issue

```bash
# Standard approach
npx tsx scripts/linear-ops.ts create-issue "Project Name" "Issue title" "Description"
```

> **Note**: If you need to target a specific team and `create-issue` picks the wrong one, use GraphQL with explicit `teamId`:
>
> ```bash
> # Get the project's team
> npx tsx scripts/query.ts 'query { projects(filter: { name: { containsIgnoreCase: "PROJECT NAME" } }) { nodes { id name teams { nodes { id name key } } } } }'
>
> # Create with explicit teamId
> npx tsx scripts/query.ts 'mutation { issueCreate(input: { teamId: "TEAM_UUID", projectId: "PROJECT_UUID", title: "Issue title", description: "Description" }) { success issue { id identifier url } } }'
> ```

### Step 3: Upload the image and attach to the issue

```bash
npx tsx scripts/upload-image.ts /tmp/shared-image-0.png ENG-123 "Optional comment text"
```

The script will:
1. Upload the file to Linear's S3 storage
2. Post a comment on the issue with the image embedded as markdown

**Supported formats**: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, PDF

### Known pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `create-issue` picks wrong team | Multiple teams in workspace | Use GraphQL with explicit teamId (see Step 2) |
| `upload-image.ts` "Issue not found" | Issue was deleted before attaching | Ensure issue exists first |
| Image not found on disk | Shared inline, not as file | Extract from session JSONL (Step 1) |

---

## Critical Requirements

### Issues → Projects → Initiatives

**Every issue MUST be attached to a project. Every project MUST be linked to an initiative.**

| Entity | Must Link To | If Missing |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Issue | Project | Not visible in project board |
| Project | Initiative | Not visible in roadmap |

See **[projects.md](projects.md)** for complete project creation checklist.

---

## Conventions

### Issue Status

- **Assigned to me**: Set `state: "Todo"`
- **Unassigned**: Set `state: "Backlog"`

### Labels

Uses **domain-based label taxonomy**. See [docs/labels.md](docs/labels.md).

**Key rules:**
- ONE Type label: `feature`, `bug`, `refactor`, `chore`, `spike`
- 1-2 Domain labels: `security`, `backend`, `frontend`, etc.
- Scope labels when applicable: `blocked`, `breaking-change`, `tech-debt`

```bash
# Validate labels
npm run ops -- labels validate "feature,security"

# Suggest labels for issue
npm run ops -- labels suggest "Fix XSS vulnerability"
```

## SDK Automation Scripts

**Use only when MCP tools are insufficient.** For complex operations involving loops, mapping, or bulk updates, write TypeScript scripts using `@linear/sdk`. See `sdk.md` for:

- Complete script patterns and templates
- Common automation examples (bulk updates, filtering, reporting)
- Tool selection criteria

Scripts provide full type hints and are easier to debug than raw GraphQL for multi-step operations.

## GraphQL API

**Fallback only.** Use when operations aren't supported by MCP or SDK.

See **[api.md](api.md)** for complete documentation including:
- Authentication and setup
- Example queries and mutations
- Timeout handling patterns
- MCP timeout workarounds
- Shell script compatibility

**Quick ad-hoc query:**

```bash
npm run query -- "query { viewer { name } }"
```

## Projects & Initiatives

For advanced project and initiative management patterns, see **[projects.md](projects.md)**.

**Quick reference** - common project commands:

```bash
# Create project linked to initiative
npm run ops -- create-project "Phase X: Name" "My Initiative"

# Update project status
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase X" in-progress
npm run ops -- project-status "Phase X" completed

# Link/unlink projects to initiatives
npm run ops -- link-initiative "Phase X" "My Initiative"
npm run ops -- unlink-initiative "Phase X" "Old Initiative"
```

**Key topics in projects.md:**
- Project creation checklist (mandatory steps)
- Content vs Description fields
- Discovery before creation
- Codebase verification before work
- Sub-issue management
- Project status updates
- Project updates (status reports)

---

## Sync Patterns (Bulk Operations)

For bulk synchronization of code changes to Linear, see **[sync.md](sync.md)**.

**Quick sync commands:**

```bash
# Bulk update issues to Done
npm run ops -- status Done ENG-101 ENG-102 ENG-103

# Update project status
npm run ops -- project-status "My Project" completed
```
